# Data_Exploration_and_Cleaning_1
Using tools of analysis in python, I explored this data, cleaned it to ensure that it is optimal for analysis. Bad data, bad results!

This data is a public data on customer credit card defaults. The goal is to predict the probability that a customer would defualt in his or her
card payments. The first step and porbably the most arduous step in any data science project, is cleaning, exploration and refining the data.

This particular project is devoted to the subtle nuances I learned and applied in cleaning and exploring datasets using python 
analytical tools and packages.
